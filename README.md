This code is forked from its [original repo](zihangdai/mos). Some modifications are made into it  to satisfy our project needs. Most results are here, some scripts won't run because the required folders (saved models) are not uploaded to Git because of space

The paper and our report can be found [here](paper_report/)

Our goal was to reproduce mainly the rank estimations done in the original paper.
